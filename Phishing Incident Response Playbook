# Phishing Incident Response Playbook

### 1. Detection & Analysis
- [ ] **Analyze Header:** Check 'From' address vs. 'Return-Path' and verify SPF/DKIM/DMARC status.
- [ ] **URL/Attachment Triage:** Scan URLs in VirusTotal/urlscan.io. Run attachments in a sandbox (e.g., Any.Run).
- [ ] **Scope Impact:** Use SIEM/Email logs to identify all recipients of the same message.

### 2. Containment
- [ ] **Block Indicators:** Add malicious URLs/IPs to firewall and email gateway blocklists.
- [ ] **Reset Credentials:** If the user clicked a link and entered data, immediately reset their password and revoke active sessions.
- [ ] **Purge Email:** Delete the malicious email from all user mailboxes globally.

### 3. Eradication & Recovery
- [ ] **Endpoint Scan:** Run a full EDR/AV scan on machines that opened the attachment.
- [ ] **MFA Review:** Verify if MFA was bypassed or if new MFA devices were registered.

### 4. Post-Incident
- [ ] **User Awareness:** Provide targeted security training to the affected users.
