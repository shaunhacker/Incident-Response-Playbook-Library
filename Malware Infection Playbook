# Malware Infection Playbook

### 1. Detection & Analysis
- [ ] **Identify Malware:** Extract file hashes (SHA256) and query Threat Intel (VirusTotal/Talos).
- [ ] **Determine Persistence:** Check Registry keys, Scheduled Tasks, and Startup folders for unusual entries.
- [ ] **Network Callback:** Identify C2 (Command & Control) IP addresses in traffic logs.

### 2. Containment
- [ ] **Isolate Host:** Use EDR to isolate the infected machine from the network.
- [ ] **Disable Accounts:** Disable the user account associated with the infection to prevent lateral movement.

### 3. Eradication & Recovery
- [ ] **Clean/Reimage:** Delete malicious files. If persistence is found, reimage the machine from a known-good backup.
- [ ] **Patching:** Identify and patch the vulnerability (e.g., outdated software) that allowed the infection.

### 4. Post-Incident
- [ ] **Detection Update:** Create a SIEM alert for the specific hash or C2 IP found.
